The big three are Aramark, Chartwells, and Sodexo. These only buy from local farmers when it happens through preferred distributors, like Sysco. \n* Independently operated cafeterias and regional food service companies (Epicurean Feast) and Guckenheimer are more inclined to buy directly from farmers.\n* Food Hub Logistics https://redtomato.org/regional-supply-chain/logistics/ [[Red Tomato Food Hub]]\n\t* Distribution Center Model\n\t* Plan B -- direct store delivery (rely on distribution partners).\n\t* List of food hubs: ams.usda.gov/market-news\n\t* https://cms.agr.wa.gov/WSDAKentico/Documents/DO/RM/RM/18_SellingThroughFoodHubs.pdf\n* Selling to restaurants: https://home.localfoodmarketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Food-Hubs-Guide-to-Selling-to-Restaurants.pdf\n\t* Make sure you know how they are currently sourcing food and the value you offer. \n\t* Food hub can drastically reduce restaurant admin costs by delivering all goods in a single delivery and a single invoice. Price is not typically teh main barrier in working with restaurants.\n\t* Don't compete with producers, especially since some will already have restaurant customers.\n\t* https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/fpcreports/1/\n* Selling to Grocery Stores and Food Cooperatives\n\t* https://cms.agr.wa.gov/WSDAKentico/Documents/DO/RM/RM/15_SellingToGroceryStoresAndFoodCooperatives.pdf\n\t* Prepare\n\t\t* Farm story, product samples, list of planned products for the season, contact info, certifications like GAP (good agricultural practices) or organic.\n\t\t* Required level of commercial or liability insurance, product/packaging specifications the buyer has in mind, expected process for placing orders and invoicing, working together to increase product visibility.\n\t* Pricing\n\t\t* Subtract 35-45% from retail or farmers market price to create wholesale price.\n\t\t* Most grocery stores pay 15-30 days after delivery.\n\t\t* Grocery stores may want a UPC number (unique 8 or 12 digit number that identifies a manufacture and their product). These can be expensive. A full list is at plucodes.com.\n\t* Delivery\n\t\t* Boxes labeled with farm name, product description, and amount of product. Products should be sized or graded to industry standards.\n\t* Aggregation\n\t\t* Some farms join together in producer marketing co-ops or aggregation food hubs to market to grocers.\n\t\t\t* Okanogan Producers Marketing Association formed in 2006, and is a good example of how 5 small family farms formed a co-op to market and deliver a large variety of fresh fruit and vegetables to grocery stores around the state, in one truck with one invoice.\n* Selling fresh fruits and vegetables https://cms.agr.wa.gov/WSDAKentico/Documents/DO/RM/RM/37_SellingFreshFruitsAndVegetables.pdf\n\t* Most common direct marketed products, sold at farmers markets, through CSAs, or direct to restaurants. \n\t* Inspection may be needed if time from production is too high or total pounds sold per crop is over 2000 pounds per day.\n* Farm Marketing Analysis: https://dyson.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/02/smart-marketing-2017-05.pdf\n* More than 80% of all direct market food sales occurred within 100m of the farm.\n* CSA contributed only 7.5% of total direct marketing sales. CSAs aren't for every farm, but for the ones who do, they are a sizable portion (26.2% income).\n* ![[Pasted image 20230819004933.png|300]]\n\n[[Food Hub]]\n[[Red Tomato Food Hub]]\n\n### Marketing Resources\nhttps://dyson.cornell.edu/outreach/smart-marketing-newsletter/\n![[Pasted image 20230819005144.png|300]]",
