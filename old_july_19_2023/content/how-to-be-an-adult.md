# Purpose
To me, the purpose of your 20s is to put yourself in as many different environments and experiences as possible to observe your true personality to see what you truly enjoy or don't. This is helpful for 
learning more about the world, finding interesting friends and hobbies, and simply having cool stories to tell your friends and family down the road.
