This is not a substitute for a certified AIARE avalanche course.

### Snow Layers
* Rounded snow is strong. Faceted snow is weak and has weak links.
* Faceting happens 
* **Temperature Gradient** happens because the ground is insulated, so lower layers of snow are less cold. This is typically 0c. The outermost layer varies due to wind chill and air temp.
* Warm air holds more moisture than cold air. Since it's warmer near the ground, there's more moisture near the ground. This vapor pressure wants to move up.
* Crystalline structure needs moisture to keep it, but this moisture moves upward.


### How does snow round?
The slower moisture leaves, the faster snow rounds! The deeper the snowpack, the lower the ratio of difference to depth.
You want a smaller temperature gradient. This prevents the moisture from quickly exiting before it gives snow time to round.

### Crusts
There are two types -- sun and rain. Sun always melts snow that has a strong southern aspect, which refreezes at night forming a hard crust.
Rain crusts form when cold temperatures freeze moisture following a rain event. It's really smooth; a sheet of ice on top of snowpack.

### Avalanche Problems
9 major problems. 

#### Dry Loose
* Unconsolidated snow releasing
* Result of snow not consolidating in a cohesive layer
* Shape of a fan

#### Wet Loose
* Release of unconsolidated snow high in water content. 
* Start from a point and move it in a fan shaped path downhill.
* Caused by intense sun and rain.

#### Cornice Fall (like a wave)
* Wind blows unconsolidated snow grains up and over a peak and creates a lip.
* This ridge can break and fall onto underlying terrain.

### Trigger Layer Causes
* Weak Layers
* Stress on weak layer is large

### Weak Layers (involve 6 types of avalanches)
Layers in the snow that serve as points of failure.
* Facets: Sugary, uncohesive snow. Pointy on the micro-level, low structural integrity.
* Surface Hoar (frozen equivalent of dew): layers are harder to trigger naturally but easy to trigger with external force. Can carry a lot of force if applied slowly (naturally).
