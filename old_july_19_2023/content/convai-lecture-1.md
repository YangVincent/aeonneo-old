## Applications: 
* Information Retrieval
* Text Classification (Disaster Response)
* Sentiment and Social Meaning
* Edit Distance (Computational Bio, Comparing Sequences)
* Graph of social relations

### Sentiment Analysis
* Positive reviews tend to refer to sex, drugs, and dessert ("addicted to food"). Higher end restaurants are more likely to get sex-related comments, the opposite has drug-related comments.
* Negative reviews tend to refer to mental health trauma and refer to "we"

## Interacting with Humans
* Language is difficult because of ambiguity
* Non-standard language (emojis, hashtags, names)

## Models & Tools
* Regex
* Edit Distance
* Word embeddings
* Language models
* ML Classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, NN)
* Network algs (Pagerank)
* Recommender Algs (Collaborative Filtering)
* Linguistic tools (Sentiment, Emotion lexicons)

### Neural Word Embeddings
* Read a ton; move words next to each other based on how frequently they show up with that proximity.
