title: Unincorporated Association
---

An unincorporated association happens when people group together to work on something (for profit or not). Profit is capped at
5k before requiring registration. Nonprofits automatically get 501(c)3 status here, although it's difficult to claim deductions since 
these aren't registered with the IRS.
