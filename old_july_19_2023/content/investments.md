You want your money to *work for you*. that means that it grows and earns money 24/7. You retire when the amount of money your money is earning is enough money to live on. (What a mouthful). So what are your different options for doing so?

You can be as active or as passive as you like. Active options take a lot of time, like creating your own business, tutoring high schoolers, or working a second job. Passive options may be active at first like 
being a landlord, writing a book, or drop-shipping, but get to the point where they sit and make money for you with no extra work. You also have a few options for investment accounts.

Investment accounts are helpful for liquid investing, which allows you to get your money back fairly easily.

# 401k Investment Account
Your employer might offer a 401k. This is a tax-advantaged account, which means it involves means for you to pay less taxes. These used to be for employees of private companies to get pension (the employer
continuously pays you through retirement), but now those aren't very common. Instead, 401k's give the option to dedicate some amount of money to your retirement account. This is a little
different from adding to your savings account in your bank for 3 reasons. First, it allows you to put pre-tax income into the account (where it + any gains from investments are taxed on withdrawal). Second,
it also allows you to put post-tax income into the account. When this investment grows, you don't have to pay capital gains tax (taxes on investment growth) when you withdraw. Third, it's possible your
company has a matching program, in which they'll contribute (basically free) money to your account as long as you contribute.

In general, you want to reduce your taxable income because it allows you to maximize the money you have growing at an early stage in your career (more time for growth).

The downside of a 401k is (a) if your employer doesn't provide it, you have fewer options, (b) you can't take out the money until retirement (65 or so, although there are exceptions like if it's been in your account for 5 years), and (c) you can
only invest in what your provider offers (so none of your friends' startups, bitcoin, real estate, etc.)

If your employer allows, you might be able to do a [[megabackdoor]] -- to put even more money in tax-advantaged accounts.

# HSA/FSA
This is another tax-advantaged account. Maximize the amount you'd put in here because it too can grow without paying capital gains tax. Additionaly, you should save your receipts (and pay them off) for any health appointments now, then reimburse these on the HSA account (which has presumably grown)
at any point in the future. An HSA is also good because it minimizes your taxable income. The FSA is the same, except that you're required to spend it within the year on select healthcare items (such as contacts or glasses). Only contribute to this whatever you're sure to spend.
