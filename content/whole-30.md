title: Whole 30
---

Whole 30 is an elimination diet helful for AB testing what foods you might have adverse reactions to that you simply never noticed.
The premise is that humans may have never evolved to eat certain foods and as such, these foods cause health problems.

[Rules](https://whole30.com/whole30-program-rules/)

The categories are 

### Added sugar (real or artificial) 
Type 2 diabetes, prevent obesity

### Alcohol

### Grains (wheat, rye, barley, oats, corn, rice, millet, quinoa, etc)
Refined grains are high in carbs that get digested and absorbed quickly, which spikes blood sugar and hunger/cravings. Whole grains might be much better,
but contains gluten which is a protein 10% of people are sensitive to. [Healthline on Grains](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grains-good-or-bad#section9)

### Legumes (beans, chickpeas, peanuts, soy, miso)
Rich in protein and fiber, but may contain antinutrients that interfere with digestion. In general, they improve blood pressure, reduce cholesterol, lower heart
disease risk, and promote weight loss. [Healthline Legumes](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/legumes-good-or-bad#bottom-line)

### Dairy
Unnatural to consume, most of the world is lactose intolerant. Stimulates release of insulin; perhaps linked to acne. Grass-fed looks to be better all around.

### Carrageenan, MSG, sulfites
Carrageenan is an additive from red seaweed (aka Irish moss) that's used for thickening foods. There's evidence that it triggers inflammation, ulcerations, and
damages the digestive system.

### Baked goods, junk foods
