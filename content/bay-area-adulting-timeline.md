title: Bay Area Adulting Timeline
---

I've noticed that almost everyone in the Silicon Valley goes through the same phases in adulthood. This is (mostly) a joke, but really one of those jokes that just says something that's oddly relatable but you wish it wasn't.

# Year 1
Graduate! Wooo, congrats you've made it! Welcome to the real world, Neo.
Find a job, or if you already have, take a few months off to travel. Probably choose Japan or London with a spattering of
high school & college friends. If you haven't yet had a hook-up phase, this is the time. Quickly realize that nobody actually wants
to talk about how much money you (or they) make, but everyone's interested in investing and what that even looks like. (It looks like [[investments]], by the way).

Quickly settle into work and talk about the difference in perks. Complain about your commute or discuss the latest happy hour. When holiday season comes,
realize how trivial it is to bring a friend to a holiday party.

# Year 2
At this point, half the people you know have quit or switched jobs, or realized they actually hate what their parents have made them do. The other half is still chugging along, possibly worrying about promotion.
People start organizing their lives and optimizing by listening to [[podcasts]]. Some start soulcycle, zogsports, or some other class/org.

# Year 3
People really start to dive into their hobbies and new friends. Those who lived in SF only to realize they hate it move to NY and vice versa. Meditation, book clubs, and buddhism are commonplace. Marriages are slowly
becoming more frequent and less surprising. At this point, you're really good at planning trips and finding hole-in-the-wall restaurants & experiences. Consider taking a sabbatical. Some peers become incredibly rich from
early investments in Bitcoin or for selling their startups.
