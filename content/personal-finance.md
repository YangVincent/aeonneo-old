Congrats on your first job out of college! This is aimed at helping you understand how to navigate the financial world now that you have
a reasonable source of income. If you don't read anything else, follow ![this flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpg).

# Retirement
In general, the point of a job (besides personal fulfillment) is to make money for retirement. One common misconception is that you save money to the point that 
you have enough to spend for the rest of your projected life. For example, that means if you predict to live for 30 years in retirement and if you spend 50k/year,
then you should save 1.5 million (ignoring inflation).

IMO, this isn't very reliable, especially if you predict wrong and have no money left. Instead, you want to save
enough money to the point that the investment gains are roughly equal to your annual spend + inflation.

Specifically, (ignoring inflation), if you spend 50k/year and your investments grow at 1%/year, then if you retire at 5 million, then you'll be able to just spend the amount it grows per year.

# 401k
Your employer might offer a 401k. This is a tax-advantaged account, which means it involves means for you to pay less taxes. These used to be for private employees to get pension (the employer
continuously pays you through retirement), but now those aren't very common. Instead, 401k's give the option to dedicate some amount of money to your retirement account. This is a little
different from adding to your savings account in your bank for 3 reasons. First, it allows you to put pre-tax income into the account (where it + any gains from investments are taxed on withdrawal). Second,
it also allows you to put post-tax income into the account. When this investment grows, you don't have to pay capital gains tax (taxes on investment growth) when you withdraw. Third, it's possible your
company has a matching program, in which they'll contribute (basically free) money to your account as long as you contribute.

In general, you want to reduce your taxable income because it allows you to maximize the money you have growing at an early stage in your career (more time for growth).

The downside of a 401k is (a) if your employer doesn't provide it, you have fewer options, (b) you can't take out the money until retirement (65 or so, although there are exceptions like if it's been in your account for 5 years), and (c) you can
only invest in what your provider offers (so none of your friends' startups, bitcoin, real estate, etc.)

If your employer allows, you might be able to do a [[megabackdoor]] -- to put even more money in tax-advantaged accounts.

# HSA/FSA
This is another tax-advantaged account. Maximize the amount you'd put in here because it too can grow without paying capital gains tax. Additionaly, you should save your receipts (and pay them off) for any health appointments now, then reimburse these on the HSA account (which has presumably grown)
at any point in the future. An HSA is also good because it minimizes your taxable income. The FSA is the same, except that you're required to spend it within the year on select healthcare items (such as contacts or glasses). Only contribute to this whatever you're sure to spend.
