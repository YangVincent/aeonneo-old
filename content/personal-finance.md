Congrats on your first job out of college! This is aimed at helping you understand how to navigate the financial world now that you have
a reasonable source of income. If you don't read anything else, follow [this flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.jpg).

# Retirement
In general, the point of a job (besides personal fulfillment) is to make money for retirement. One common misconception is that you save money to the point that 
you have enough to spend for the rest of your projected life. For example, that means if you predict to live for 30 years in retirement and if you spend 50k/year,
then you should save 1.5 million (ignoring inflation).

IMO, this isn't very reliable, especially if you predict wrong and have no money left. Instead, you want to save
enough money to the point that the investment gains are roughly equal to your annual spend + inflation.

Specifically, (ignoring inflation), if you spend 50k/year and your investments grow at 1%/year, then if you retire at 5 million, then you'll be able to just spend the amount it grows per year.

So... how do you begin with [[investments]]?
