title: What does it mean to live a good life?
---

What is the purpose of life? Personally, it's to maximize *living*. I realize this is
kind of a cop-out answer, so allow me to elaborate on what that actually means.

Life (and our perception of [[time]]) is largely segmented on [[emotion]] and intense experiences.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any single topic I'm exceptionally passionate about. To me,
this means I don't know what meaning I want to fulfill with the entirety of my life. Therefore, my interim
life purpose is just that -- to search for one. It's fully possible I'll never find an ultimate life purpose, 
but there's nothing to do but try searching.

Luckily, I very much enjoy the search. I can work in a greedy algorithm-fashion by taking things I know to be personally fulfilling.
Other people have always been fascinating to me, so I tend to find people who're fun to be around and dive into hobbies
with them. That's largely how I got serious at [[snowboarding]] and [[cycling]].

But what makes a meaningful life -- a life that you respect but wouldn't envy, like a person who dedicates their life to research but neglects friends and family,
or perhaps a life that's easy with no real challenge?

The Greeks have an idea called Eudaimonia, which roughly translates to flourishing and prosperity. This is closely linked with arete (excellence) and phronesis (practical and ethical wisdom).
