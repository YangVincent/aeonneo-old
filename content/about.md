Welcome to my notes! Visit the sites at the bottom to learn about the philosophy
behind them.

Thinking about:

* **[[Purpose]]**: How can we best reach our (and help each other reach their) raisons d'Ãªtre?
* **Social Relations**: How might we better understand each other and our motivations?
* **Content Curation & Consumption**: What's the intent behind our content consumption? If it's to be entertained or to learn, how might we do so optimally?
How can we balance information overload and having limited time?
* **Second Brain**: How can we offload things our minds are bad at (memorization, search & retrieval)? Are graph-based notes in a BFS/DFS layout (inspired by [Andy Matsuchak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)) 
a good solution? What if we consumed news, research, and general learning in this way as well?
* **[[Security]]**: Why is trust bad?
