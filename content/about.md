title: About these notes

Hi, I'm [Vincent Yang](https://www.yangvincent.com)

These are the scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts that run in my head. 
Have a sneak peak into my brain. 
These notes don't have an index of all the things I write, so keep clicking through the things you find interesting. 
And if a note resembles with you, please let me know. If you strongly. disagree in a note, they you should tell me for sure. 
Send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=532906019) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aravindballa) and we can talk.

I'm getting into the habit of [[Writing]] again, and as a result, I have a few notes lying around in [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=3102f5265a104fcab0afd4ec98f0c9dc).

Present areas of focus are

- Day job
- [[Learning Curve]] podcast
- Creating content
