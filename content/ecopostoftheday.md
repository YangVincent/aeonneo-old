## Marketing Learnings
* Do your marketing in bursts. You want this flurry of increased interactions with your page to interact with each other and push the algorithm into showing your content.
* You can identify if you're shadowbanned by following someone, then refreshing and checking if that follow went through.
* Every good buffer system (queue up future posts) costs money.
* People love content with massive text on it (because they don't want to read the captions).
* Find people whose profiles show they're interested in growing a following and have high likelihood of following back.

## Personal Learnings
* I don't really care about marketing, but I really enjoy finding cool facts about the world. I use [[the Siphon]] to search for these facts. Relevant: [[Hosting Trivia]]
* Efficient work should be async unless it qualifies as fun work -- then it should be synchronous.
