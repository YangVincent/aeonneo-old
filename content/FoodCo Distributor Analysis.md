* Many cafeterias are no longer independently operated, but turn to food service companies. The big three are Aramark, Chartwells, and Sodexo. These only buy from local farmers when it happens through preferred distributors, like Sysco. 
* Independently operated cafeterias and regional food service companies (Epicurean Feast) and Guckenheimer are more inclined to buy directly from farmers.
* Food Hub Logistics https://redtomato.org/regional-supply-chain/logistics/ [[Red Tomato Food Hub]]
	* Distribution Center Model
	* Plan B -- direct store delivery (rely on distribution partners).

* Selling to restaurants: https://home.localfoodmarketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Food-Hubs-Guide-to-Selling-to-Restaurants.pdf
	* Make sure you know how they are currently sourcing food and the value you offer. 
	* Food hub can drastically reduce restaurant admin costs by delivering all goods in a single delivery and a single invoice. Price is not typically teh main barrier in working with restaurants.
	* Don't compete with producers, especially since some will already have restaurant customers.

* Selling to Grocery Stores and Food Cooperatives
	* https://cms.agr.wa.gov/WSDAKentico/Documents/DO/RM/RM/15_SellingToGroceryStoresAndFoodCooperatives.pdf
	* Prepare
		* Farm story, product samples, list of planned products for the season, contact info, certifications like GAP (good agricultural practices) or organic.
		* Required level of commercial or liability insurance, product/packaging specifications the buyer has in mind, expected process for placing orders and invoicing, working together to increase product visibility.
	* Pricing
		* Subtract 35-45% from retail or farmers market price to create wholesale price.
		* Most grocery stores pay 15-30 days after delivery.
		* Grocery stores may want a UPC number (unique 8 or 12 digit number that identifies a manufacture and their product). These can be expensive. A full list is at plucodes.com.
	* Delivery
		* Boxes labeled with farm name, product description, and amount of product. Products should be sized or graded to industry standards.
	* Aggregation
		* Some farms join together in producer marketing co-ops or aggregation food hubs to market to grocers.
			* Okanogan Producers Marketing Association formed in 2006, and is a good example of how 5 small family farms formed a co-op to market and deliver a large variety of fresh fruit and vegetables to grocery stores around the state, in one truck with one invoice.
* Selling fresh fruits and vegetables https://cms.agr.wa.gov/WSDAKentico/Documents/DO/RM/RM/37_SellingFreshFruitsAndVegetables.pdf
	* Most common direct marketed products, sold at farmers markets, through CSAs, or direct to restaurants. 
	* Inspection may be needed if time from production is too high or total pounds sold per crop is over 2000 pounds per day.
* Farm Marketing Analysis: https://dyson.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/02/smart-marketing-2017-05.pdf
* More than 80% of all direct market food sales occurred within 100m of the farm.
* CSA contributed only 7.5% of total direct marketing sales. CSAs aren't for every farm, but for the ones who do, they are a sizable portion (26.2% income).
