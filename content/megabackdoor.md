[[Capital Gains Tax]] is tax you pay on the growth of your investment. If your investment grows 50% over 20 years, it is the taxes you'd have to pay
on the extra 50%.

A mega backdoor Roth is a way of contributing larger after-tax amounts to **tax-advantaged accounts** (an account where you don't have to pay capital gains tax).

# Why might I want to do this?
Suppose I think my investments will grow immensely, but I don't want to pay capital gains tax on them. I also want to reduce my taxable income, and don't plan on spending the money before I retire (perhaps towards a house or other investments).
In this case, I'll want to put as much as possible into a Roth IRA. You can do this with a megabackdoor Roth.

A [[Roth IRA]] is an IRA (a tax-advantaged account) where you make after-tax contributions. These contributions grow tax-free.

A megabackdoor Roth increases the amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA. You do this by contributing the maximum possible to a Roth 401k, then
use your service provider (Vanguard, in my case) to roll it over.

You want to convert from a 401k to an IRA because IRA owners may withdraw money at any time, while you must reach a distribution event to withdraw from a 401k (becoming disabled, leaving your employer, reaching 59.5 years old, and death).

# But how about IRA maximums?
The IRA contribution limits apply only to the amount of money you put into an IRA account per year (6k in 2019). The backdoor works because rolling it over from a 401k is a conversion, not a contribution and thus
bypasses this limit.

# Give me an example?

In 2019, the total amount of combined employee and employer contributions to tax-advantaged accounts allowed is $56,000 for those under 50. This means the maximum amount of after-tax contributions is $37,000 (56,000 - 19,000 = 37,000). 19,000 is the maximum
401k pre-tax employee contribution. If your employer matches (mine matches up to 9,500), then this becomes (37,000 - 9,500 = 27,500) so I can contribute $27,500 in after-tax contributions to a tax-advantaged account.

So how do I get all 56,000 into tax-advantaged accounts?

First, I contribute the maximum into my 401k -- 19,500, and get the 9,500 employer match. Then, I contribute the rest (27,500) in after-tax contributions to my provider (Vanguard). In Vanguard, I also set in-plan conversion,
so the moment it hits the Roth 401k, it'll actually roll it over into my Roth IRA. I highly recommend doing this, because otherwise you have to mess with paying tax on the amount that's grown in the time between 
adding the money to the account and rolling it over.

# Frontloading
I tend to frontload my contributions towards the front of the year. This can be good or bad. I do it to maximize the time for it to grow, although this disallows me from [[dollar cost averaging]].
