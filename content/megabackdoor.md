[[Capital Gains Tax]] is tax you pay on the growth of your investment. If your investment grows 50% over 20 years, it is the taxes you'd have to pay
on the extra 50%.

A mega backdoor Roth is a way of contributing larger after-tax amounts to **tax-advantaged accounts** (an account where you don't have to pay capital gains tax).

A [[Roth IRA]] is an IRA (a tax-advantaged account) where you make after-tax contributions. These contributions grow tax-free.

A megabackdoor Roth increases the amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA. You do this by contributing the maximum possible to a Roth 401k, then
use your service provider (Vanguard, in my case) to roll it over.

You want to convert from a 401k to an IRA because IRA owners may withdraw money at any time, while you must reach a distribution event to withdraw from a 401k (becoming disabled, leaving your employer, reaching 59.5 years old, and death).

# But how about IRA maximums?
The IRA contribution limits apply only to the amount of money you put into an IRA account per year (6k in 2019). The backdoor works because rolling it over from a 401k is a conversion, not a contribution and thus
bypasses this limit.
