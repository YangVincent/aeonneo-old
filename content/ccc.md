title: Content Curation and Consumption
---

## Why do we consume the content we do?

This is still an open problem for me. Thus far, I've identified that I enjoy various mediums:
reading, video, music, informational audio. An ideal answer here would be
a list of categories, an intent behind why I care about each category, and
a way for me to find high quality content to best fulfill the intent. 

For example, one category might be comics, read with the intent to let me relax
and laugh, so high quality content might come from the Far Side or Calvin & Hobbes.

### Reading
I read to be entertained for short periods of time (short stories and r/AITA; <20 minutes),
to learn about the world (longform reports, articles, and books), and to stay up to date
about my hobbies (news posts about ski resorts or artists).

### Video
I enjoy watching Youtube for hobbies (biking, snowboarding), entertainment (short films, dance, MVs), and
education (Kursesagt, Ray Dalio). Netflix is also helpful for entertainment and education.

## How can we improve the quality of our inputs?

### Reading
The web is a wide, wide place. Visiting only a handful of websites feels unrepresentative of
the world's information. Currently, I subscribe to many different rss feeds with feedly and
am considering paying for membership to allow for IFTTT integration. This would let me use
mobile swipe to "Read Later", then sync these marked articles to Pocket. Pocket has a superior
"reading view" and allows me to publish rss feeds of what I consume, which is helpful for analysis.

In Feedly, I've separated inputs into categories: Hobbies, Longform, and Other (most popular from all over the web).
