# Basic Routine
Wash your face in the morning and night. Wear sunblock.

# Less Basic Routine
Part 1: Prepping things/cleaning your face
Part 2: Things are good for your face, and therefore "positive"

## Part 1
* Oil Cleanser cleans out pores
* Water cleanser washes off oil and general dirt
* Toner closes your pores again to prep them
* Essence is strong toner for areas where you have problems (redness/wrinkles)

## Part 2
* Serums are customizable for detailed problems
* Eye cream makes your skin softer like a baby
* Moisturizer replentishes everything you've washed off
* Optional periodic further moisturizers (facemasks)

Wear sunblock every day.
